# Point Blank

Point Blank is a VS Code extension that provides a powerful outliner mode for plain text and Markdown files. It enhances readability and navigation by providing indent-based code folding, custom bullet point decorations, and a focus mode to hoist the current block into focus.

## Features

- **Indent-Based Folding:** Automatically creates folding ranges based on indentation, allowing you to collapse and expand blocks of text.
- **Custom Bullet Points:** Provides a variety of bullet point decorations to visually distinguish between different list item types.
- **Focus Mode:** A command to fold all code blocks except for the one containing the cursor, helping you focus on the current context.
- **Configurable Colors:** Customize the colors of the bullet point decorations to match your theme.

## Supported Files

- Plain Text (`.txt`)
- Markdown (`.md`)
- Untitled files
