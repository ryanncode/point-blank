    <h2>Core Features</h2>

    <h3>Intelligent Bullet Point Styling</h3>
    <p>Point Blank enhances standard markdown lists by applying custom styling directly to the bullet characters (<code>*</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, etc.). For convenience, the extension can be configured to automatically <strong>insert</strong> a default bullet point on a new line. However, once inserted, this character is treated just like any other text in the document. The rendering engine's job is only to <strong>style</strong> what is physically present in the file.</p>
    <p>The following prefixes are recognized and styled:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>*</code> (asterisk)</li>
        <li><code>+</code> (plus)</li>
        <li><code>-</code> (minus)</li>
        <li><code>1.</code>, <code>1)</code> (numbered lists)</li>
        <li><code>></code> (blockquote)</li>
        <li><code>@</code> (at-sign, for special mentions or commands)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hierarchical Outlining & Folding</h3>
    <p>The core of the outliner is its ability to create a hierarchy based on indentation. Users can create nested lists simply by indenting lines. The extension uses this structure to provide robust, indentation-based code folding, allowing users to collapse and expand sections of their outline to easily navigate large documents.</p>

    <h3>Typed Nodes for Structured Data</h3>
    <p>A key feature of Point Blank is the concept of "typed nodes." By writing a line like <code>(Book)</code>, users can create a structured data block. This block can contain key-value pairs (e.g., <code>Author:: John Doe</code>) that are visually distinguished and can be navigated with custom keybindings, streamlining data entry.</p>

    <h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
    <p>
      Point Blank's template system has been significantly refactored to provide
      a more robust and intuitive way to create structured data.
    </p>

    <h3>File-Based Templates</h3>
    <p>
      Templates are now defined as Markdown files (<code>.md</code>) and stored
      in a dedicated directory: <code>.vscode/templates/</code> within your
      workspace. Each template file must begin with a required
      <code>Type::</code> key-value pair, which defines the type of the node
      this template will create.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a template for a "Task" node would be saved as
      <code>.vscode/templates/Task.md</code> and start with:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-markdown">Type:: Task
Status:: TODO
Due::
Tags::
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Template files can optionally include <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2760373">YAML front matter</a>
      at the very top of the file, enclosed by triple-dashed lines (<code>---</code>).
      This front matter can be used for additional metadata about the template
      itself (e.g., author, description), but it is *not* inserted into your
      document when the template is expanded inline. It is primarily used for
      features like the "Quick Open File Type Template" command.
    </p>
    <p>Example with YAML front matter:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-markdown">---
description: A template for creating new task items.
author: Your Name
---
Type:: Task
Status:: TODO
Due::
Tags::
</code></pre>

    <h3>Inline Template Expansion</h3>
    <p>
      The syntax for inline template expansion has been updated for clarity and
      consistency. To insert a typed node using a template, simply type the
      template's <code>Type</code> name followed by <code>::</code> and a space.
      For example, to insert a "Task" node, you would type:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-markdown">Task:: </code></pre>
    <p>
      Upon typing the space after <code>Task::</code>, the extension will
      automatically expand the template, inserting the key-value pairs defined
      in your <code>Task.md</code> file directly into your document. The
      <code>Type::</code> line you typed will be replaced by the template's
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, typing <code>Task:: </code> would expand to:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-markdown">Type:: Task
Status:: TODO
Due::
Tags::
</code></pre>
    <p>
      This new syntax ensures that the inserted content is always a clean list
      of key-value pairs, without an extra "node type title line" that was
      present in previous versions.
    </p>

    <h3>Focus Mode</h3>
    <p>Focus Mode allows users to "hoist" a specific folding block, collapsing all other sections of the document. This provides a distraction-free environment for concentrating on a single part of a larger outline.</p>
