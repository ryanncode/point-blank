    <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
    <p>The extension's architecture is designed to be modular, performant, and maintainable, centered around an immutable document model that serves as the single source of truth.</p>

    <h3>Data Flow:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>When a document is opened or modified, VS Code fires an event that is picked up by the <code>DocumentModel</code>.</li>
        <li>The <code>DocumentModel</code> uses the <code>DocumentParser</code> to create or update the <code>DocumentTree</code>, an immutable, hierarchical representation of the document's text.</li>
        <li>The <code>DocumentModel</code> notifies the <code>DecorationManager</code> of the change.</li>
        <li>The <code>DecorationManager</code>, using debouncing and viewport-aware logic, retrieves the visible <code>BlockNode</code>s from the <code>DocumentTree</code>.</li>
        <li>It passes these nodes to the <code>DecorationCalculator</code>, which determines the appropriate decorations for each node based on its properties (e.g., <code>bulletType</code>).</li>
        <li>The <code>DecorationManager</code> applies these decorations to the active editor, styling the existing text.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Key Design Decisions</h2>

    <h3>Immutable Document Model</h3>
    <p>The use of an immutable <code>DocumentTree</code> and <code>BlockNode</code>s is a cornerstone of the architecture. When the document changes, a new tree is created rather than modifying the old one. This provides predictability, simplifies state management, and makes the flow of data easy to trace.</p>

    <h3>Design Philosophy: Insertion vs. Styling</h3>
    <p>A critical distinction in Point Blank's architecture is the separation between one-time character <strong>insertion</strong> and continuous visual <strong>styling</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insertion</strong>: For user convenience, some features will insert text directly into the document. For example, the <code>expandTemplate</code> command writes a new block of text, and the extension can be configured to add a bullet point on a new line.</li>
        <li><strong>Styling</strong>: This is the core of the rendering engine. After a character has been inserted (or typed by the user), it is treated like any other character in the document. The decoration engine <strong>only styles what it sees</strong>; it does not use rendering tricks to display characters that aren't physically present in the file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This "real character" styling philosophy is the result of a major refactor to improve stability and interoperability. It provides key benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Robustness & Interoperability</strong>: Because the document is always the single source of truth for rendering, it remains pure markdown. This prevents conflicts with other VS Code extensions and ensures the file is portable.</li>
        <li><strong>No "Ghost" Characters</strong>: The previous architecture attempted to render visual-only characters, which led to conflicts with the document model and other editor features. The current approach eliminates this entire class of bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Separation of Concerns</h3>
    <p>The architecture enforces a strong separation of concerns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Parsing (<code>DocumentParser</code>):</strong> Solely responsible for converting text to a <code>DocumentTree</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>State (<code>DocumentModel</code>, <code>ExtensionState</code>):</strong> Manages the state of the document and the extension.</li>
        <li><strong>Rendering (<code>DecorationManager</code>):</strong> Manages the application of decorations to the editor.</li>
        <li><strong>Logic (<code>DecorationCalculator</code>):</strong> Contains the stateless logic for determining which decorations to apply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Performant Decorations</h3>
    <p>To ensure a smooth user experience, the decoration engine includes two key performance optimizations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Debouncing:</strong> Decoration updates are debounced to prevent rapid, flickering updates while the user is typing.</li>
        <li><strong>Viewport-Aware Rendering:</strong> The <code>DecorationManager</code> only processes the visible portion of the document (plus a small buffer), which significantly improves performance in large files.</li>
    </ul>
